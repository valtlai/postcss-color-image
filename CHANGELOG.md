# Changelog

## [5.0.0] (2022-10-30)
- BREAKING: Renamed the recognized color `color-contrast()`
  to `contrast-color()` ([csswg-drafts#7557]([csswg-issue-7557]))
- BREAKING: Dropped the support for Node.js 12 and 17
  (so Node.js 14, 16, and 18 or greater are now supported)

## [4.0.0] (2022-01-27)
- BREAKING: Instead of duplicating the color in the output gradient,
  a double-position color stop is now added
  to make the output shorter and more DRY
  - For example, the old output `linear-gradient(red, red)`
    is now `linear-gradient(red 0 0)`
  - For wider browser support, you can use the old behavior
    by setting the new option `compat: true`
- BREAKING: Removed `color-adjust()` as a recognized color,
  because it has been removed from the spec
- Added a new option `preserve: true`
  to keep the original CSS declaration alongside the transformed one
- Changed the license from MIT to ISC

## [3.1.0] (2021-10-20)
