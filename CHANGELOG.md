[`5.0.0...v6.0.0`](https://github.com/valtlai/postcss-color-image/compare/5.0.0...v6.0.0)

## 5.0.0 (2022-10-30)

[`4.0.0...5.0.0`](https://github.com/valtlai/postcss-color-image/compare/4.0.0...5.0.0)

## 4.0.0 (2022-01-27)

- BREAKING: Instead of duplicating the color in the output gradient,
  a double-position color stop is now added
  to make the output shorter and more DRY
	- For example, the old output `linear-gradient(red, red)`
	  is now `linear-gradient(red 0 0)`
	- For wider browser support, you can use the old behavior
	  by setting the new option `compat: true`
- BREAKING: Removed `color-adjust()` as a recognized color,
  because it has been removed from the spec
- Added a new option `preserve: true`
  to keep the original CSS declaration alongside the transformed one
- Changed the license from MIT to ISC
